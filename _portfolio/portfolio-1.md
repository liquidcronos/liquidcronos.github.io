The TriPed is new robot at the [Aries Lab](https://www.lorenzomasia.com/lab-and-people). It was build according to our specifications at the university of stutgart.
The Final Aim of this Project is to study cooperation between machines and humans or machines and machines. 
But before this is possible the robot needs to be actuated. For this purpose we developed a hardware and software architecture and implemented embedded controllers and interfaces to higher behaviors
