The lecture robotic Games is a colaboration between me and Holger Dieterich focussing on higher level reasoning.
The lecture was further improved from its last iteration by focussing more on decision making systems and streamlining the syllabus.
Due to covid the lectures where livestreamed and later uploaded to youtube.
