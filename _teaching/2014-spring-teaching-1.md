The lecture robotic Games was originaly the brainchild of Holger Dieterich.
After the first iteration of the lecture i expressed interest to help him improve and shape the lecture.
Since then we have continued to work on it and refined it.

In this iteration we focused on structure.
While the original version of the lecture was more free form project based, this semester we aimed at introducing weekly exercise sheets that would guide the students as they deepend their knowledge of mobile robotics and ROS.



Contents:
======
* Behavioral-based recursive, nested control structure (RNBC)
* Kinematics of wheeled mobile robots
* Non-holonomic control
* Foundations of game theory in particular non-cooperative two-player games, e.g.
Cat and Mouse
* Practical implementations and experimental testing of the methods and
algorithms used


Final Project
======
The final Project had the students split into groups to develop their own robot.
The requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/liquidcronos/liquidcronos.github.io/blob/master/files/aufgabenstellung_rg_ws1920.pdf)
