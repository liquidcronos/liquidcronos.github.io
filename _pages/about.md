### TriPed Robot

I love developing robotics and control systems applications. Although my main experties is higher level planning and control, i also enjoy the challenges of embedded development.
My current project combines these two areas.
The  [TriPed Robot](https://triped-robot.github.io/) is a plattform to study decentralized cooperative control algorithms.
